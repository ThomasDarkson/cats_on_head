# Cats on Head

Cats on Head is a Fabric mod that allows you to put your tamed cats on your heads! It also includes improvements and fixes to cats.

This mod will not work with custom cats or cat variants.

### Features:

*   Makes tamed cats equippable
*   Cats can be leveled up with fishes
*   Improved cat morning gifts

## Cat Items

Cats drop strings, unless you have this mod installed. With this mod, tamed\* cats drop themselves when hit by their owner once!

\* Custom cats and cat variants and baby cats will not drop themselves as an item. ![hit](https://i.ibb.co/LXLhPfPs/New-project.gif)

You can see your cat's information on tooltip.

The item entity of cats will never disappear and only the owner can pick their cat items off the ground.

## Putting Your Cat on Your Head

When you get your cat as an item, you can put it on your head for **Love of The Feline** status effect.

When a cat is on your head, creepers will run away and never attack you.

## Love of The Feline

Love of The Feline is a status effect you get when you put your cat on your head. This status effect can be leveled up more by feeding your cat cooked cod or cooked salmon at maximum health.

Your cat's level is the same as Love of The Feline's level, they both depend on how many fish is fed.

Every **64** fish fed to your cat, the effect gets leveled up. Maximum level is **5**.

Level **1** beneficial effects (Fed fish >= 0):

*   +**6** attack damage

Level **2** beneficial effects (Fed fish >= 64):

*   Every effect from Level **1**
*   100% underwater movement speed

Level **3** beneficial effects (Fed fish >= 128):

*   Every effect from Level **2**
*   Jump boost and Immunity to fall damage

Level **4** beneficial effects (Fed fish >= 192):

*   Every effect from Level **3**
*   60% damage protection

Level **5** beneficial effects (Fed fish >= 256):

*   Every effect from Level **4**
*   Every living entity drops 4 strings on death
*   50% more luck to get better loot from fishing

## Sleeping

If you sleep with your cat on your head, your cat will get off your head and will sleep with you instead.

If your cat's level is higher than 1, your cat's morning gifts will change based on the level. The chance of your cat giving you a gift increases every level (if it's higher than 1), 15% for every level. When level is 3 or higher the morning gifts are guaranteed.
